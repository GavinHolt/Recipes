# Spicy Pulled Chicken Taco Filling

Serves 4-6 depending on what you are having with it!

Rough time end-to-end is 90 minutes

## Ingredients

### Fresh Ingredients

- 1 Tablespoon olive oil
- 400G Skinless Chicken Breast or Thigh (Bone-in/Boneless doesn’t matter, but boneless will be much easier)
- 500ML Chicken Stock (I made from a stock cube)
- 2x400G Cans of Chopped Tomatoes
- 2xMedium-Large Pepper (Colour is your choice) chopped into a medium slice/dice
- 1xMedium White/Brown Onion, chopped into a medium slice/dice
- 2xLarge green/red chillies (deseeded and minced)
- 2x Cloves of Garlic, minced.

### Spice Mix

- 1 ½ teaspoon chili powder
- 1 teaspoon ground coriander
- 1 teaspoon paprika
- ½ teaspoon onion powder
- ½ teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper (keep the grinder handy for coating the chicken initially)
- ½ tablespoon dried oregano
- ½ teaspoon cayenne pepper

## Method

1. Heat the olive oil in a deepish pan over a medium-high heat (You will eventually want this pan to be deep enough to hold your chicken, covered by all the liquid)
2. Generously season your chicken with salt and freshly ground black pepper on both sides.
3. Once the oil is shimmering, place your chicken in the pan for around 3-4 minutes or until it starts to go golden brown.
4. Flip and cook for a further 3-4 minutes until the other side is equally browned. Remove the chicken from the pan to a plate/board/somewhere it can be safe for a while.
5. Reduce the heat in the pan to medium and add the onions, peppers and minced chilli. Stir frequently until onion starts to go translucent.
6. Add minced garlic and stir for another 1-2 minutes. Do not let the garlic burn!
7. Add spice mix gradually, ensuring all veg are coated. Cook out for 1-2 minutes until spices are smelling like they are doing something without being burned.
8. Add previously removed chicken, the chicken stock and the 2 cans of Tomatoes.
9. Bring to a boil then reduce heat to simmer for ~30 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through.
10. Remove the chicken to a (new, clean) plate and turn the heat in the pan back up to thicken the sauce. Boil for around 20-30 minutes, stirring occasionally so stuff doesn’t stick to the bottom.
11. Wait for the chicken to cool then shred into rough chunks with two forks.
12. Once the sauce has boiled until thick, return the now shredded chicken to the pan, stir to coat and simmer in the sauce for 10-15 minutes.
13. Serve with tacos, rice or whatever you feel like.

## Notes

You could add some red kidney beans as the same time as you re-add the chicken in step 12 for more protein.
