## Method

#### Crispy Beef

1. Slice beef into thin strips of around 5-7cm long, and 0.5-1cm wide/thick and place in mixing bowl.
2. Place Soy Sauce, MSG, Black Pepper, Chilli Flakes, Minced Garlic/Ginger in mixing bowl with beef and thoroughly mix (by hand is best!).
3. Leave beef to marinade for 30 minutes.
4. Place 400g Cornflower or Potato Starch into the second mixing bowl. Season generously with black pepper and mix.
5. Now is a good time to pre-heat your fryer/oil to 160c
6. One handful at a time, take the beef from the first mixing bowl and place it into the flour/starch mixing bowl. Toss the beef in the starch until it is well and fully coated. Shake off any excess and place beef onto a plate/tray. Repeat this for all the beef.
   1. Add more starch/flour if needed.
7. Once all the beef is coated, and your fryer/oil at around 160c. In small batches (so you don't cool the oil down too much), fry the beef for 60-90 seconds. Remove from the oil and place on the track/lined dray to drain. Repeat this for all the beef.
8. Once all the beef is done, raise the temperature the oil up to 180c. Once at temperate, repeat the process, frying the beef for 60-75 seconds before removing and placing on a rack to drain.
9. You should now have a very crispy finish on your beef.

### Sauce

1. In a measuring jug/bowl, mix the orange juice, lemon juice, light soy sauce, water, sweet chilli sauce, siracha sauce and honey.
2. In a large pan/wok, add the oil and gently fry the garlic and ginger. Do *not* let this burn.
3. Once fragrant, pour in the liquid and bring to the boil.
   1. Be sure to stir often, as you do not want garlic, ginger or any solids from the sweet chilli sauce to stick to the bottom and burn
4. Once boiling, keep on an aggressive simmer for 8-10 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened and is looking glossy.
   1. You want the sauce to coat the beef well, but not become too sticky, err on the side of caution and go under, rather than over if it comes to it!

### Combine

Turn off the heat and add the beef to the sauce. Toss thoroughly until the beef is coated.

If your sauce was a bit on the watery side, now is the time to crank the heat back up and try to get rid of some more water, but don't let the beef get soggy.

### Garnish

Place Crispy Chilli Beef on a plate/in a bowl and add slices of Red Chilli and Spring Onion. Finish with a sprinkling of sesame seeds.

Serve with rice, on its own.
